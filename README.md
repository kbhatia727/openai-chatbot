# README

This is a Ruby on Rails project that integrates the OpenAI API to create a chatbot application. The OpenAI API integration is set up, but asynchronous processing using ActiveJob will be added in the future for handling API requests in the background. The user interface and styling will also be developed in later stages of the project.

Features
Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3 (or other models).
Future Development: Asynchronous processing using ActiveJob to handle OpenAI API requests in the background.
Future UI and styling: The frontend and design will be added later.
